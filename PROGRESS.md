# a2ext progress

Follow [PLAN.md](PLAN.md). Update this file and commit after every numbered step.
Only mark a step complete when its stated checks pass. Separate documentary,
automated, and physical validation.

## Status

- Plan recorded; implementation starting at step 1.
- Steps 1-21: pending.
- Hardware acceptance: not tested; no assembled hardware available in this session.

## Work log

### Planning baseline — 2026-09-17

- Saved the agreed 21-step implementation plan, including the per-step progress
  update and commit rule.
- Confirmed the WeAct reference module is present and KiCad CLI/CMake are
  installed. ARM GCC and Ninja are not on PATH; investigate before step 11.
- The user's staged `.gitmodules` and WeAct submodule addition predate this work;
  preserve those changes and exclude them from task commits unless requested.
- Validation: inspected repository status and local module reference paths.
- Blockers: none for starting documentation; hardware power sequencing and
  physical qualification remain explicit later gates.
